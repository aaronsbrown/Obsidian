# 🧠 DIGITAL TAROT OS: MASTER OVERVIEW

A logic-based, brutalist tarot system built from symbolic circuitry, Deleuzian ontology, and raw generative signal.

This system reimagines tarot as a computational ontology—where logic gates, electronic metaphor, and symbolic syntax form the basis for reading, reflection, and ritual. Each card functions as both symbol and signal—circuit and archetype.

## 🧩 STRUCTURE

### Suits (Minor Arcana)
Each suit is tied to a Boolean operation, representing different modes of symbolic logic:

- **OR** — Accumulation, possibility, emergence  
- **AND** — Coherence, interlock, activation  
- **XOR** — Ambiguity, conflict, contrast  
- **NOT** — Reversal, negation, inversion  

Each suit has:
- **10 Pips** (numbered cards)
- **4 Court Cards**:  
  - **Byte** (Page) — raw data  
  - **Pulse** (Knight) — signal in motion  
  - **Register** (Queen) — stored meaning  
  - **Frame** (King) — structured interpretation  

---

### ⚡ Event Cards (Universal Logic)
Special cards representing meta-logical structures. These appear randomly in readings and reshape the “logical flow” of interpretation:

- **Implication (→)**  
- **Biconditional (↔)**  
- **Conditional Negation**  
- **Contradiction (⊥)**  
- **NAND (Sheffer Stroke)**  
- **NOR (Pierce Arrow)**  

These are the **connective tissue** of the system. They influence how the other cards "compute."

### 🜁 Major Arcana (Ontological Glyphs)
High-order concept cards—each representing a state of being, cosmic condition, or recursive principle in the symbolic engine:

- **Kernel** — The hidden source; unmanifest computation  
- **Signal** — Manifestation; becoming-in-motion  
- **Frame** — Perception container; structuring logic  
- **Error** — Corruption; signal drift  
- **Carrier** — Underlying substrate of meaning  
- **Entropy** — Heat death; final dissolution  
*(More to be added)*

## 🛠 Reading Mode & Circuit Flow

- Cards are laid out on a **powered backplane**—a symbolic “Body without Organs.”
- Cards connect logically depending on suit & placement.
- The **reading becomes a live circuit**, with current flowing based on symbolic polarity.
- Certain cards (like NAND or NOR) introduce **universal branching or collapse**.

Readings may follow logical configurations:
- Vertical = Voltage (High to Ground)
- Horizontal = Flow or Conjunction
- Central card = Evaluation node / Flip-flop
- Metastability is possible (indeterminate reading states)

---

## 🧪 Visual + Interactive Layer

Each card can be paired with:
- A **TouchDesigner visualization** driven by procedural noise, feedback loops, and symbolic glyph overlays.
- An **electronic version**—possibly implemented on a powered PCB with LEDs representing state.
- Or a **printed brutalist aesthetic**, combining Franklin Booth/Aubrey Beardsley sinew with PCB schematics.
