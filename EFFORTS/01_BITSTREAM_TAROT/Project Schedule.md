## **Scaffold the Sacred: Making a Structure for a Chaotic Project**

  

We want to build a **project scaffolding** that does 3 things:

1. **Harvests the current momentum**
    
2. **Breaks the concept into meaningful stages**
    
3. **Leaves room for mystery, but not chaos**

### **🔻 PHASE 1: “TANGIBLE MYSTICISM”**

  

_Capture what you already have while it’s hot._

  

#### **❖ Milestone 1: Project Charter (1–2 days)**

- **Title** (working): “Digital Arcana: A Logic-Based Tarot”
    
- **Scope**: What it _is_ and what it _isn’t_
    
- **Components**:
    
    - 4 logic-suit minors (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
        
    - 2 universal gates (NAND/NOR) as resonance/meta cards
        
    - Major Arcana reinterpretation (TBD)
        
    - Reading system based on logic flow
        
    - Visual + physical design plan (PCB cards? Etchings? App?)
        
    
- **Goals**: 1 deck prototype + interpretive booklet + 1 functional “spread mode”
    

  

Store in a Notion, Obsidian, or physical book of shadows. Get it _out_ of your head.

### **🔻 PHASE 2: “THE HEXAGRAM HACK”**

  

_Map the project as a_ **_hexagram or logic circuit_**_. Seriously._

  

Draw it as a circuit flow:

- Inputs: research, lore, previous obsessions
    
- Gates: idea refinement, prototypes
    
- Flip-flops: moments of reevaluation
    
- Outputs: real-world artifacts
    

  

Build this as a **one-page dashboard**, either visually or digitally.

### **🔻 PHASE 3: “PROJECT RITUALIZATION”**

  

_Turn process into_ **_ritual_**_—to keep the candle burning._

  

#### **❖ Weekly Cycle (repeatable):**

- **1x Wildstorm Day** (free sketch, ideation, weird dive)
    
- **1x Build Day** (card design, writing, electronics)
    
- **1x Showcase Ritual** (post or send to someone, even just me)
    
- **Ongoing**: Whisper Journal (capture stray thoughts; no pressure)
    

  

Use a **tracker**. Not for shame. For rhythm. (Also lets you _quit honorably_ if it really dies.)

---

### **🔻 PHASE 4: “MAKE A PLAYABLE THING FAST”**

  

_Give the project legs before the Muse stops feeding it._

  

Create a **Mini Proof of Concept** deck:

- 4 cards (AND, OR, NAND, XOR)
    
- Simple reading logic
    
- 1 layout system (like a 3-card logic gate spread)
    
- PDF or Figma version
    

  

Let it _exist_, even if it’s crude. That’s your talisman against entropy.

---

### **🔻 PHASE 5: “LIGHT FROM OUTSIDE”**

  

_Inject cross-domain fuel._

- **Show to 1 person** (art buddy, coder, tarot head)
    
- **Steal structure** from something adjacent:
    
    - Board game design docs
        
    - Modular synth UI design
        
    - Tarot zines (structure, pacing, tone)
        
    
- Let it **echo** your past obsessions without needing to _be_ them
