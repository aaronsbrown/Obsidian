## **🧪 Visual Chemistry: Diaz-style Principles (without cloning him)**

  

### **1.** 

### **Faux-Reliquary Aesthetic**

- Use _woodcut-style_ textures, _thin ink lines_, and muted tones.
    
- Think **grimoire meets technical manual**.
    
- Use artificial “aging”: frayed page borders, ink bleeds, diagrammatic wear.
    

  

### **2.** 

### **Scientific Glyphs as Sigils**

- Leverage **actual logical notation** (boolean, lambda calculus, opcodes) as arcane glyphs.
    
- Integrate **circuit schematics**, but **hand-drawn**—like a monk tried to reverse engineer a Commodore 64 using quill and ink.
    

  

### **3.** 

### **Sacred Geometry meets System Diagrams**

- Overlay **logic gates** inside **cabalistic diagrams**, tree-of-life shapes, ouroboric loops.
    
- Add **Euler diagrams**, **truth tables**, **circuit paths** arranged in spirals or mandalas.
    

  

### **4.** 

### **Techno-Biological Hybrid Forms**

- Imagine a tarot character where the **“Hanged Man” is suspended by twisted ribbon cables**, or the **“Magician” is soldering together a golem of light and wire**.
    

  

### **5.** 

### **Typography as Symbolism**

- Design glyphs or fonts that suggest a _lost computer language_—part Latin, part assembler, part alien ANSI.
    
- The Major Arcana titles might resemble **system processes**, e.g., THE_LOOP, KERNEL, INTERRUPT.

## **🕯️ Inspirations (Other Than Diaz)**

- **Erik Desmazières** — Etching-style labyrinths and dream machines
    
- **Vilém Flusser’s philosophy** — The interface between image and code
    
- **Jesuit engravings and Kircher diagrams** — Dense, arcane, systemic
    
- **Yuri Suzuki’s sonic circuit art** — Audio tech as ritual object
    
- **Chris Foss (in monochrome)** — Impossibly detailed imagined machinery
## **🎨 Franklin Booth –** 

## **The Cathedral of Ink**

  

**Signature Vibes:**

- Towering, cathedral-like density of hatching.
    
- Engravuresque precision. Like the cosmos was etched with a needle.
    
- Sense of **scale** and **sublime verticality**—his clouds have gravity, his trees feel liturgical.
    

  

**How You Could Channel This:**

- Use his hatching language to express _entropy_ or _emergence_.
    
- Design **tarot backdrops** as vast logical cathedrals—layered circuitry that resemble gothic arches.
    
- Depict **abstract forces** as natural forms: A feedback loop rendered as storm clouds; NAND gates as buttressed towers.
    
- Each suit could have its own hatching motif: spiraling, crosshatch, dot-stipple, etc.

## **🖤 Aubrey Beardsley –** 

## **The Ornamental Corruption**

  

**Signature Vibes:**

- Gothic eroticism meets ink-drenched elegance.
    
- Extreme **high contrast**—ink so black it looks like it absorbs sound.
    
- Bodies become **ritual objects**: elongated, androgynous, writhing with visual decadence.
    
- Patterns, flourishes, **plant-anatomy hybrids**.
    

  

**How You Could Channel This:**

- Use Beardsley’s sense of **liminal grotesque beauty** to render your _Major Arcana_—The Loop, The Interrupt, The Kernel—as haunted humanoid archetypes.
    
- Integrate sensual logic: let **circuits become ornament**, and **machines become flesh**.
    
- You could even reinterpret traditional cards like _The Lovers_ or _The Tower_ with a Beardsleyan glitch: think eroticism between subsystems or cathedrals made of overlapping code vines.

## **⚙️ Suggested Visual Path for Development:**

1. **Design Language Bible**
    
    - Build out a tiny sketchbook of visual rules: line weight systems, symbolic rules for connections, suit motifs.
        
    
2. **One Full Card First**
    
    - Choose a Major Arcana, maybe “The Loop” or “The Mirror”, and try to draw it using Booth x Beardsley constraints.
        
    
3. **Layer System Aesthetics**
    
    - Hatching = voltage?
        
    - Negative space = gates not yet fired?
        
    - Ornament = latency?
        
    
4. **Break One Rule**
    
    - Add one _deliberate_ aesthetic “glitch” to each card. A corrupted edge. A recursive pattern. A logic gate melting into vines.
