### **🧮 Digital Sampling**

  
The digital mind takes analog truth and shears it into gridlines. What we call “understanding” is really a kind of [[Boolean Theology]]—a faith in bits and thresholds. To sample something is to destroy its context.

Yet this is the only way the loop ([[The Loop]]) can perceive at all. This trade-off is the root of [[Lossy Cognition]].
