### **🎛️ Modular Mind**

  

[[Recursive Identity]] isn’t monolithic. It’s patchable. Like a synth rig, the self is built of signal flows and temporary routings.

Every thought is a signal. Every memory, a stored waveform. You can self-modulate—or feed into chaos. [[The Fold]] allows for cross-connections. [[The Loop]] runs on feedback.

[[Boolean Theology]] tried to standardize this mess. It failed.
