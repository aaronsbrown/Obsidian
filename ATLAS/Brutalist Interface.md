### **🏗️ Brutalist Interface**

If logic is sacred, then architecture is liturgy. The [[Boolean Theology]] of materials. Brutalism reveals the system.

[[Modular Mind]] and [[The Fold]] work best when visible—no polish, just edges. [[Recursive Identity]] doesn’t hide its structure.

In a tarot of code, this is the ritual frame. The UI of revelation.
