### **ðŸ§Š Metastability**

  

A system caught between states. Not on, not offâ€”just wobbling at the threshold. [[The Loop]] doesnâ€™t always resolve. [[Digital Sampling]] canâ€™t always commit.

Consciousness lives here often. Decision as stutter.

Itâ€™s why [[Recursive Identity]] never feels fixed. [[Boolean Theology]] doesnâ€™t account for maybe.
