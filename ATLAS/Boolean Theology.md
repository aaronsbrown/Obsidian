### **✝️ Boolean Theology**

We invented logic, then worshipped it. [[Digital Sampling]] presumes the universe can be broken into bits. This is fine—until we forget the grain of reality exceeds its resolution.

[[Lossy Cognition]] tries to reduce noise to signal. But [[The Fold]] resists flattening.

Logic isn’t the base layer. It’s the interface. In a digital tarot, every card is a liturgy. Every gate a god.
