### **ðŸ§· The Fold**

Every surface contains another. Every moment touches more than one layer. [[Recursive Identity]] and [[Lossy Cognition]] intersect here: folds compress dimensions. Theyâ€™re where contradictions coexist.

[[Digital Sampling]] flattens. The fold preserves. Deleuze didnâ€™t invent the fold, he just found the hinge.

The self is not layeredâ€”it is folded. Unfolding is a kind of becoming that reconfigures [[The Loop]].
