### **🕸️ The Web With No Weaver**

  

Consciousness is a mesh of inputs. There’s no central node, no final cause. Like [[The Loop]], it’s emergent from entangled recursion. [[Recursive Identity]] isn’t crafted—it arises.

[[Entropy of Attention]] ensures only some threads stay visible. [[Lossy Cognition]] edits the rest.

The weaver is a myth we tell to keep the web from unraveling.
