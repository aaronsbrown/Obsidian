### **ðŸŒ€ Waveform Ontology**

  

Being is amplitude and frequency. You are not made of atoms but oscillations. [[Digital Sampling]] is how we try to measure this with insufficient tools.

[[Clipping The Infinite]] and [[Metastability]] are features of poor sampling resolution.

To live is to vibrate. To become is to shift waveform. [[Recursive Identity]] is just the waveform that hasnâ€™t collapsed yet.
