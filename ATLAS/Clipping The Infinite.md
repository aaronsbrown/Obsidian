### **ðŸ“‰ Clipping the Infinite**

  

When the signal exceeds its bounds, it doesnâ€™t disappearâ€”it clips. The waveform is flattened, its extremes erased. This is not failureâ€”itâ€™s adaptation.

The psyche, like audio, compresses intensity via [[Lossy Cognition]]. The clipped material becomes distortion, sometimes reemerging as [[Recursive Identity]] glitch.

[[Entropy of Attention]] ensures you canâ€™t hold the full amplitude of being. So you become something smaller.
