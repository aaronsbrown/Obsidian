### **ðŸ§  Lossy Cognition**

Human consciousness is a [[Digital Sampling]] engine. Every moment is a waveform too rich for perception, so the mind compresses itâ€”filtering reality into manageable packets of meaning. This is lossy compression, not high-fidelity. We forget nuance to remember narrative. As [[Entropy of Attention]] increases, only symbols remain. [[The Fold]] ensures that what gets flattened still holds echoes of the full form.

Our stories arenâ€™t what happenedâ€”theyâ€™re what didnâ€™t get deleted. A fold of experience reduced to bytecode.
